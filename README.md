# Database-Management-System-Implementation
The project involves the development of a Database Management System that allows users to easily manage their 
data. From the user's point of view, the system will model the data in the form of tables containing rows and 
columns. However, internally, the system will store the tables in files, either in comma-separated values (CSV) 
or tab-separated values (TSV) format. To interact with the system, a case insensitive query language has been 
designed, enabling users to interact in a natural way to manage both tables and the data inside them. Users will be 
able to perform the following operations: 
▪ Create Statement: To create a new table with the name and columns provided by the user 
▪ Drop Statement: To delete an existing table  
▪ Show Statement: To show all the tables 
▪ Insert Statement: To insert a new row in a given table 
▪ Select Statement: To retrieve rows from a given table 
▪ Update Statement: To update rows in the table 
▪ Delete Statement: To delete rows from a given table 
▪ Help Statement: To display the syntax of each of the above 7 statements 
▪ Exit Statement: To terminate the program
